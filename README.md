# ShoesRenownTracker

Addon to track renown of alt covenants. It is possible you will encounter issues. 
As of now I am not providing support for it so know that beforehand. Feel free to post 
an issue if you find one and I'll try to check it periodically.

Commands: 
/srt
```

The addon will need to see each character and covenant at least once to get the initial data, 
so make sure you log through your characters and swap around to each covenant so that they are 
all added.
